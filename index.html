<title> Rui Xia Introduction</title>  
<body>
<p>
    My name is Rui Xia and I am from China. 
I am currently a junior student majored in Electrical Engineering at Penn State University.
<br /><br />
    I spent my fist 18 years in Guangzhou, a northeast city in China.
My hometown is the third developed city in China with well-built railway system. 
It is famous for its snacks and food. 
After graduating from high school, I planned to study abroad so I focused on learning SAT and TOEFL. 
I decided to go to PSU for my undergraduate study because it located in a quiet and harmonious town.    
Instead of living in a crowded and noisy city, I prefer to live in a beautiful small town so that I can relax my mind and concentrate on learning knowledge.
<br /><br />
    When I first entered college, I did not decide my major and I did not know what I was going to do in my rest of my life.
Fortunately, my advisor and my high school teacher helped me a lot during that hard time.
They encouraged me to take various courses in the first year and figured out my interests as my future career.
I lately found that electron physics attracted me most, so I chose to major in electrical engineering in my sophomore year.
Although most courses in electrical engineering are tough, I still quite enjoy with my major because I love my major.
During my sophomore and junior year, I joined several engineering clubs and a drama club and I spent joyous years with my club members. 
My club members not only taught me a lot about how to build and finish a project but also encouraged me to insist on my major.
<br /><br />
    During my free time, I like to watch a movie and watch a drama. 
Since my major courses are hard and time-consuming, I will relax by watching a funny movie such as Zootopia and Storks.
In the weekend sometimes my friends and I will watch a drama in state theater. 
Last week we watched “No man’s land”, a drama talking about four mans’ conversation in one house.

<title> Rui Xia Introduction</title>  
<body>  
My name is Rui Xia and I am from China. 
I am currently a junior student majored in Electrical Engineering at Penn State University.
I spent my fist 18 years in Guangzhou, a northeast city in China.
My hometown is the third developed city in China with well-built railway system. 
It is famous for its snacks and food. After graduating from high school, I planned to study abroad so I focused on learning SAT and TOEFL.

<title1> Rui Xia Introduction</title1>  
<body>
<p1>
<br />
    My name is Rui Xia and I am from China. 
I am currently a junior student majored in Electrical Engineering at Penn State University.
<br /><br />
    I spent my fist 18 years in Guangzhou, a northeast city in China.
My hometown is the third developed city in China with well-built railway system. 
It is famous for its snacks and food. 
After graduating from high school, I planned to study abroad so I focused on learning SAT and TOEFL. 
I decided to go to PSU for my undergraduate study because it located in a quiet and harmonious town.    
Instead of living in a crowded and noisy city, I prefer to live in a beautiful small town so that I can relax my mind and concentrate on learning knowledge.
<br /><br />
    When I first entered college, I did not decide my major and I did not know what I was going to do in my rest of my life.
Fortunately, my advisor and my high school teacher helped me a lot during that hard time.
They encouraged me to take various courses in the first year and figured out my interests as my future career.
I lately found that electron physics attracted me most, so I chose to major in electrical engineering in my sophomore year.
Although most courses in electrical engineering are tough, I still quite enjoy with my major because I love my major.
During my sophomore and junior year, I joined several engineering clubs and a drama club and I spent joyous years with my club members. 
My club members not only taught me a lot about how to build and finish a project but also encouraged me to insist on my major.
<br /><br />
    During my free time, I like to watch a movie and watch a drama. 
Since my major courses are hard and time-consuming, I will relax by watching a funny movie such as Zootopia and Storks.
In the weekend sometimes my friends and I will watch a drama in state theater. 
Last week we watched “No man’s land”, a drama talking about four mans’ conversation in one house.

<body>

<br />
The Pennsylvania State University (commonly referred to as Penn State or PSU) is a public, land-grant, research-intensive university with campuses and facilities throughout Pennsylvania.
Founded in 1855, the university has a stated threefold mission of teaching, research, and public service.
Its instructional mission includes undergraduate, graduate, professional and continuing education offered through resident instruction and online delivery.
Its University Park campus, the flagship campus, lies within the Borough of State College and College Township.
It has two law schools, Penn State Law, on the school's University Park campus, and Dickinson Law, located in Carlisle, 90 miles south of State College.
The College of Medicine is located in Hershey. Penn State has another 19 commonwealth campuses and 5 special-mission campuses located across the state.
Penn State has been labeled one of the "Public Ivies," a publicly funded university considered as providing a quality of education comparable to those of the Ivy League.
<br /><br />
Annual enrollment at the University Park campus totals more than 46,800 graduate and undergraduate students, making it one of the largest universities in the United States.
It has the world's largest dues-paying alumni association.
The university's total enrollment in 2015–16 was approximately 97,500 across its 24 campuses and online through its World Campus.
<br /><br />
The university offers more than 160 majors among all its campuses and administers $3.45 billion (as of June 30, 2014) in endowment and similar funds.
The university's research expenditures totaled $813 million during the 2014 fiscal year.
<br /><br />
Annually, the university hosts the Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon (THON), which is the world's largest student-run philanthropy.
This event is held at the Bryce Jordan Center on the University Park campus. In 2014, THON raised a program record of $13.3 million.
The university's athletics teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are collectively known as the Penn State Nittany Lions. They compete in the Big Ten Conference for most sports.

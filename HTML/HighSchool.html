Inscription of Zhang Zhidong's Memorial on the Establishment of Guangya Academy
Guangya (廣雅 / 广雅) was known as its Cantonese postal romanization "Kwong Nga" at that time. In this article, "Guangya" instead of "Kwong Nga" was used since the school did not actually have a formal English name then.
In a memorial to the imperial court, Zhang Zhidong stated his motivations for establishing Guangya Academy (廣雅書院 / 广雅书院). He wrote on the necessity of favoring scholarship to create an educated social atmosphere in Liangguang.
He also cited inadequate capacities of several existing academies for taking in students. He was granted permission to purchase 124 mu (8.27 hectares or 20.4 acres) of land in northwest Guangzhou (known as Canton at that time) for the academy. 
Construction started on June 11, 1887 and completed a year later at a cost of 138,866 taels of silver. The academy opened on July 16, 1888 with an annual budget of 17,150 taels of silver. The inaugural head of the academy was Liang Dingfen, a scholar whom Zhang Zhidong frequently consulted with education issues.

[Evolution]
In the over 120 years of its history, Guangya High School evolved with the development of the modern history of China. 
Until the collapse of Qing Dynasty, Guangya Academy and its successors remained a traditional Chinese academy where Zhang Zhidong's doctrine of "Chinese learning for fundamental principles, Western learning for practical application" (Chinese: 中學為體，西學為用) was practiced. 
In 1912, under the rule of the newly founded Republic of China, the academy, which had stopped admitting students from Guangxi and become known as Guangdong Advanced Academy, was reorganized as Guangdong Provincial No. 1 High School and was the first high school ever established in Guangdong.
The school adopted the western system of three-year junior and senior secondary education in 1922 and opened a senior department in 1924 when the first batch of junior students graduated under the new system. In 1928, educator Liang Shuming was appointed as the principal and proposed the motto "Endeavor in the Fundamentals and Pursue the Truth" (Chinese: 務本求實). 
The name "Guangya" was restored as the school was renamed Guangdong Provincial Guangya High School in 1935, then dropped in 1939 as the school moved out of Guangzhou after the city fell to the Japanese forces during the Sino-Japanese War, and restored again in 1941.
<br />
The current name "Guangdong Guangya High School" was first used in 1949 under the rule of the People's Republic of China. 
During the Cultural Revolution, the school was renamed Guangdong Red Flag School and later Guangdong Red Flag High School, an evident reflection of the political zealotry of the era. It was redesignated as Guangzhou No. 54 High School in 1969. The last renaming occurred in 1978. 
The current name was restored and has remained in use since.

They gave us the task to try to turn wood pallets into a closed loop recycling process and that is exactly what we did. We took the needs they wanted and turned them into multiple different ideas, but only one worked well enough. We came up with the most economically sound plan that is explained in detail with in this report. </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c3">Index</span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c3">Introduction-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c3">Customer Needs-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------4</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c3">Problematic Areas-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------5</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c3">Concept Generation--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------5</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c3">Concept Selection-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------6</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c3">Final Design Description-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------7-15</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c3">Conclusion-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------15</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c3">References-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------16</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Introduction </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report is based on the idea that Arcelormittal wants to utilize its waste products and become a more environmentally friendly company. For example, in this specific report we will focus on improving the use of wood pallets used to ship products to Arcelormittal&rsquo;s company. By the time the pallets arrive to the company they do not know the best possible solution for dealing with them. It is mandatory that the process being implemented will abide to the companies needs and wishes. For example, the number one wish from the company is to make sure that the process has a closed loop. This means that the process needs to be a continuous cycle that never ends. Luckily, the design made will give a great representation of a possible solution to Arcelormittal&#39;s dilemma. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design has a couple very important steps that it needs to follow to become a closed loop cycle. First, Arcelormittal has to obtain and collect all the wood pallets that are sent to them. Then from there, the pallets would be separated between the old pallets and the newer pallets. This is done because the newer pallets would be turned into furniture. After the furniture becomes very run down, like the older pallets, both will be transformed into the environmentally friendly wood fibre insulation. After the insulation reaches its shelf life it would go through the process of becoming paper. This is where the loop is formed due to the fact that the paper made can be recycled over and over again. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process is economically and environmentally friendly. It provides a great way to make newer profits besides the steel products already being sold. Not only this, but the process itself will successfully close the loop and easily abide by the customer needs. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Customer Needs Analysis</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the concept generation our group had discovered some very basic needs that had to be fulfilled by our process chosen. The first need that came to our minds is that Arcelormittal wants the process we choose to increase the worth of the material and have a closed loop process. Then we realized that the new products that we choose to create need to be good looking and uphold all regulations and codes. For example, health codes and safety regulations. This is due to the fact that consumers will not want to buy products that are not appealing to the eye or may put them in danger. Also, if a consumer were to get hurt by any reason, Arcelormittal will be to blame and this will give them bad publicity. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big issue our group had when it came down to choosing a process was that the process itself needed to be economically viable. This means that the benefits to the process need to out-weigh the cost of sending the wood pallets to a landfill. This was a big issue as we needed to think about the shipping costs, machinery costs, and many more. With in the economic dilemma we had to recognize that the best way to cut down on costs were to make the location of recycling close to the companies location. Finally, the last topic had to do with reducing the waste footprint. This matter is directly tied into the need for a closed loop process because by making our process a cycle, all the materials being used are recycled in some way. Thus, the materials used and made are staying away from all landfills.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Problematic Areas</span></p><p class="c11 c20"><span class="c3">The first problem we encountered was &ldquo;closing the loop.&rdquo; We were able to think linearly, with ideas of what types of products to make out of reusable wood. These ideas included things like furniture, a playground, flooring, instruments, and hockey sticks. However, we were faced with the question of what to do when these products were no longer usable. </span></p><p class="c11 c20"><span class="c3">One idea we had was to turn wood pallets into wood foam, which could be used for packaging. However, since the production of this wood foam is an up-and-coming technique, there was not enough research on the recyclability, cost, etc. of the material. Another issue we faced was we could not find information on how many times packing peanuts could be recycled. After going back to square one, we found that instead of wood foam, wood pallets could be used to make wood fiber insulation, which would be more beneficial since it lasts longer than packing peanuts. Additionally, we know that we can produce paper from wood fiber, which can be recycled over and over. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Concept generation</span></p><p class="c11 c20"><span class="c3">We had several ideas that we started out with and changed later on for a variety of reasons. &nbsp;First we were going to take the wood pallets and just simply re-sell them as new wood pallets because we thought that it wouldn&#39;t require a lot money. &nbsp;However we realized that turning the good wood pallets into furniture would make us more money. &nbsp;Then we we realized that some of the wood pallets would not be in well enough shape to be turned into furniture that would be durable and appealing. So we had to think of something else to make from the beat up wood pallets. &nbsp;So from there we came up with wood foam insulation. &nbsp; We were originally going to turn the old pallets into wood foam insulation and then after that they would be recycled into packaging peanuts and sent to UPS. &nbsp;However after we decided that we wanted to turn the old pallets into insulation for homes we could not use wood foam insulation anymore but rather wood fiber insulation. We decided to make insulation instead because houses with insulation will hold up much longer and will not have to be recycled nearly as much as packing peanuts.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Concept selection</span></p><p class="c11 c20"><span class="c3">We select this method to recycle wood pallet basically because this method provides a close loop that meet the criteria of the ArcelorMittal company.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the view of economical benefits, Our loop contains many steps and produces different kinds of products in each step such as furniture, wood fiber insulation and paper. Every step of the loop can make profits in order to offset the costs of machine, labor and transportation. In our final step we recycle paper to paper several times so that we can not only prohibit to landfill the wasted paper but also make profits several times with each piece of paper derived from wood fiber insulation.</span></p><p class="c11 c20"><span class="c3">Besides the concern of economics, the close loop that we choose also provides environmental benefits. The perfect thing in our loop is that we don&rsquo;t have to landfill anything. Once we have done by the furniture with good wood, the furniture can be completely turned into wood fiber insulation and goes to paper at the end. After the loop of paper has been done for almost 7 times, the paper that cannot be recycled again will be composted or burnt for energy, so none of the products that we produced will end up in landfill.</span></p><p class="c11 c20"><span class="c10">What&rsquo;s more, this method is also innovative.</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">At first we try to find the loop that people have already discovered to recycle the wood pallets, but then we find that none of them meets the criteria of close loop since all of them just changes wood pallet to another products such as furniture without further steps. Then we decide to build a closed loop ourselves trying to maximize benefits and minimize costs in each step. The creative loop that we build is different from every recycling method online since we build it by our own.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Final design description </span></p><p class="c11 c20"><span class="c3">The final design of our process goes through many important steps.The first step in our process has to do with separating the wood pallets into old pallets and newer pallets. This is done because both types of pallets will be sent off to different locations. The newer wood pallets will first be turned into furniture. Then after the furniture becomes worn down, the furniture will meet up with the older pallets to go through a process of becoming wood fibre insulation. Luckily, the insulation is recyclable by becoming paper. Finally, this is where the paper can be recycled into new paper closing the loop for Arcelormittal. </span></p><p class="c11 c20"><span class="c3">Pallets are strong and versatile as proven by its number one use of being used to carry large loads making them very reliable. Each pallet can easily be turned into different types of furniture.Why would we do this? As researched we can see the top 15 trends of furniture being sold today. As seen there are 5 trends that can easily be implemented by making furniture out of wooden pallets. For example, people want to see outdoor furniture indoors, custom made furniture, environmentally friendly, small, and vintage style furniture. </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 233.50px; height: 258.65px;"><img alt="bench.jpg" src="/PICTURES/recycle05.jpg" style="width: 233.50px; height: 258.65px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11 c20"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 357.50px; height: 270.42px;"><img alt="desk.jpg" src="/PICTURES/recycle02.jpg" style="width: 357.50px; height: 270.42px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 201.00px; height: 286.50px;"><img alt="bench.jpg" src="/PICTURES/recycle05.jpg" style="width: 201.00px; height: 286.50px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11 c20"><span class="c3">As common sense may show you, to make furniture there are some small fees that are included with this process. For example, when first handling the wooden pallets it is critical to remove all nails and other material that are not the wood itself. These nails can easily be melted down specifically by the steel company for extra steel. Then the wood pallets would have to be cleaned to make sure there are no harsh chemicals left on them.(find the cost of cleaning) Then the main process of building the furniture is very important. This is true because the design of the furniture will determine if the piece will get sold enough to maximize profits. On average, the price of a wooden pallet furniture piece can range from about 50-200 dollars. This is way more than selling the individual pallets to a company because a used pallet only sells for about 5-10 dollars a piece. Although not every piece will be sold, selling only one of the pallet furniture pieces can make up for selling about 5-20 pallets individually. Finally, the shipping process needs to be in consideration as it will be costly depending on the way it is going to be sold.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided that the old wood pallets that were not durable enough to be turned into furniture, we would turn into wood fiber insulation. The process for this is as follows:</span><span class="c19 c9 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c9 c7">The raw material for the production of insulation boards are wood chips. Then they are fiberized in a conventional steam refiner and dried in a flash dryer. Next the fibers are dried and then they are blended with a special, fast curing Isocyanate resin. After pre-pressing, the mat enters a calibration and curing step using a unique preheating unit where the mat is heated rapidly by blowing a steam-air mixture through it. Finally, the endless board is cut by a diagonal saw to the required length. There are many benefits to wood fiber insulation. One benefit is that wood is a sustainable raw material</span><span class="c19 c9 c7">. </span><span class="c10 c9 c7">Its processing is not very energy intensive. Also it is positive ecologically. It also increases living comfort</span><span class="c19 c9 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c9 c7">because the thermal capacity of wood is much higher than that of mineral fiber or plastic foam. This means that wood fiber insulation protects much better against summer heat. Also, it supports uniform interior climate. The Wood-Fiber Insulation Boards is not affected by moisture which enables diffusion. Picked-up moisture will be released over time without problems. Lastly, </span><span class="c19 c9 c7">i</span><span class="c3 c7">t fits into the system for buildings based on wooden constructions. &nbsp;This wood fiber insulation is used for roofing, floorings and ceilings. The insulation can be put on top of the rafters and/or under the rafters for additional insulation. It can also be put in between rafters. As far as insulation in the walls, it can be put in the interior and exterior walls. </span></p><p class="c11 c20"><span class="c3 c7">Paper manufacturing includes the processing of wood, recovered paper and paperboard, and other cellulose fibers into thousands of end-use products. There are multiple methods that can be used to turn insulation into paper. Two of these processes are mechanical pulping, which grinds raw wood into pulp, and chemical pulping, which dissolves away the dark compounds in the wood. Paper mills differ in their processes based on the source of fiber used and the end product produced. There are three basic types of mills. </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3 c7">Pulp mills make pulp, which is a mixture of cellulose fibers and water used as the basis of all paper products. Pulp is made in several ways, depending on the type of paper being produced. Wood chips can be chemically or mechanically separated into individual wood fibers in a process called pulping. In chemical pulping, the wood chips are &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; in a digester at an elevated pressure with an appropriate solution of chemicals to dissolve the lignin (the &ldquo;glue&rdquo; that binds the fibers in the wood) and allow the cellulose fiber bundles in the wood to separate into individual cellulose fibers. Since chemical processing is gentle on the cellulose fiber, chemical pulps tend to have longer fibers and make strong paper such as printing and writing papers and paperboard. In mechanical pulping, chemicals are not used to remove the lignin in the wood chips. Instead, wood chips are pressed against a grinder that physically separates the fibers. Mechanical pulps have shorter fiber lengths and produce papers which do not require as much strength, such as newsprint. After the fibers have been separated, the mill washes and de-contaminates the pulp. The bleached or unbleached wood pulp is then pumped onto rolling wire screen mats that vibrate slightly to allow water to drain out of the pulp and to help the fibers interlock into sheets. By varying the amount of pulp pumped onto the rolling mats, the speed of the mat, and the speed of the vibrations, paper with different qualities and properties is produced. The sheets then pass through a long series of rollers that press out any remaining moisture, followed by steam-heated drums that dry the paper. Lastly, the sheets are polished and wrinkles are smoothed in a process called calendaring.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3 c7">At recycled paper processing mills, the recovered paper is combined with water in a large vessel called a pulper. The pulper acts like a blender to separate fibers in the paper sheets from each other. The resultant slurry then passes through screens and other separation processes to remove contaminants such as ink, clays, dirt, plastic and metals. The amount of contaminants that are acceptable in the pulp depends upon the type of paper being produced. </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3 c7">Some mills use both recycled and virgin fiber to make paper. These mills are typically set up to process virgin wood into pulp and incorporate recovered fiber by buying bales of recycled pulp which are added to the wood pulp. </span></p><p class="c28 c20"><span class="c3 c7">Papermaking is a very technical process that requires energy, water, wood fiber and other materials to make a finished product. Within this production stage there are many opportunities for manufacturers to address environmental performance issues, including climate change, efficient use of recovered fiber, utilizing self-generated energy and more.</span></p><p class="c20 c28"><span class="c3 c7">As a consumer, it is very important to have a reasonable understanding of what manufacturers are doing to increase their environmental performance at this critical stage of the paper life cycle. The production stage illustrates very clearly that informed environmental decisions consider multiple attributes rather than single attributes. Fiber is the single largest component in the manufacturing and use of paper and pulp products. With ever increasing demand, the efficient use of wood fiber is a critical issue. For example, the use of recycled fiber can reduce the demand for fresh fiber from forests and avoid greenhouse gas emissions.</span></p><p class="c11 c20"><span class="c3 c7">Consumers use paper to meet many different needs and each requires different and specific properties, such as strength, brightness and absorbency. Blends of both fresh and recycled fibers, in varying proportions, are being used to deliver the required properties to the consumer. While it is technically impossible to sustain society&rsquo;s long-term paper needs without freshfiber, no reusable paper should go to a landfill.</span></p><p class="c11 c20"><span class="c10">The final step of the recycling process is to recycle paper into paper, and that is how our close loop built. Since paper is a easily recycled material and can be recycled repeatedly several times, it is a close loop which can produce economical profits many times. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11 c20"><span class="c10">Below is the process to recycle paper into paper:</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 228.28px; height: 132.12px;"><img alt="" src="/PICTURES/recycle07.png" style="width: 228.28px; height: 132.12px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3 c7">a)Paper is taken from the bin and deposited in a large recycling container along with paper from other recycling bins.</span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 227.11px; height: 130.74px;"><img alt="" src="/PICTURES/recycle01.png" style="width: 227.11px; height: 130.74px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3 c7">b)The paper is taken to a recycling plant where it is separated into types and grades.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c7"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3 c7">c)The separated paper is then washed with soapy water to remove inks, plastic film, staples and glue.

Recycling paper preserves trees and forests. Every ton of recycled paper saves about 17 trees. It can effectively protect the forest from being overcut. Moreover, Making recycled paper pulp consumes less energy and water compared to generating paper pulp directly from trees. Recycling one ton of paper saves energy equivalent to the energy needed to power the average U.S. home for six months and saves about 7,000 gallons of water. In addition, Recycling paper reduces methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Paper produces the gas methane which contributes to global climate change when it is in the landfill. Trees absorb carbon dioxide but when they are cut down to make paper products, more carbon dioxide is released than absorbed. According to the EPA, recycling one ton of paper can reduce greenhouse gas levels by one metric ton of carbon equivalent. Last but not least, Paper makes up about 28 percent of solid trash in landfills and one ton of paper takes up about 3.3 cubic yards of landfill space, according to the EPA. If we recycle the paper instead of landfill it, the space used to landfill paper can be used to landfill other materials that can not be recycle.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c19">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c10">The cost to recycle paper contains the cost of machine and transportation.

It is economically efficient and easy to implement due to the fact that after the new products are made the company only needs to worry about the money they are making. This specific process fits almost all of the needs of our consumers, keeping in mind that the biggest need was becoming environmentally friendly. We had many challenges figuring out the best option or path to follow. Luckily, with our amazing new process of recycling wood pallets goes beyond just being environmentally friendly. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">References</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0"><a class="c13" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://freshome.com/2014/04/02/15-fresh-furniture-trends-watch-2014/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1492918411230000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFzgL-qIAFB1G-26rOJm6EDQtcZBw">http://freshome.com/2014/04/02/15-fresh-furniture-trends-watch-2014/</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c7 c9"><a class="c13" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/science-paper.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1492918411231000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGoejMcMw5RWB3rrOpSiYUd_HssUw">http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/science-paper.html</a></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c9 c7"><a class="c13" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://education.seattlepi.com/advantages-recycling-paper-3440.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1492918411232000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHr_FmeUF1qPVKI-_dzr3ftInFW8w">http://education.seattlepi.com/advantages-recycling-paper-3440.html</a></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0 c9 c7"><a class="c13" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/waste-paper-recycling-machine_60200956304.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1492918411233000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBY4DBue5AdwE3YhJzm7Pveyr6Yw">http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/waste-paper-recycling-machine_60200956304.html</a></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0"><a class="c13" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/80gsm-white-kraft-paper-price-per_2001891837.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1492918411234000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGeMFyXV42xso04fHRsYb3415dZAg">http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/80gsm-white-kraft-paper-price-per_2001891837.html</a></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c21"></span></p></body></html>
